# Machine-Learning-WebApplication

An interactive website with Python and Streamlit. Users can load, explore, visualize and interact with data, and generate dashboards instantly. The web application will allow users to choose a classification algorithm (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine) they want to use and let them interactively set hyper-parameter values like regularization and normalization parameters for the classifier.
The users would also be able to view the scores (Accuracy Score, Precision Score, Recall Score and F1 Score) as well as view the plotted Confusion Matrix and ROC - Curve for the chosen classifier. 
The website was tested for a mushroom dataset to classify them as edible or poisonous.
